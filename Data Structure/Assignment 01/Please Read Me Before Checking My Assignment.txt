
-> For every question's input from file, we have to change the file name accordingly in two of the functions 
   in each question, output file can be created automatically.


-> Secondly, .txt file and .cpp file should be in the same folder for the perfect execution.


-> Q1 is incomplete because I was unable to do it, I tried my best but unfortunately I didn't do complete it, 
   I'll learn that how it will be implemented. Just the logic of searching the multiple words is incomplete,
   other than that it's complete as well.


-> Q2 and Q3 are complete we just have to change the file name to see different outputs of different test cases.
